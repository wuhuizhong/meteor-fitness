TODO List:

1) Realize that mobile mods should only be made at the last set pre full deploy
2) Completion should be based on result type, then a button to finish
5) Big Complete button after logging workout
3) Movements should have more info
3a) Default exercise properties
4) Exercise Additions should be more modular (Run shouldnt show weight normally, etc)
7) Exercise collection, for pr's and shit
6) Sets? or at least set multiplier? (ex. 3x2 @195)
